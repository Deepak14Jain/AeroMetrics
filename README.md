### Install project dependencies
```
# Make sure to change to node 22
nvm use 22

# This will install all Node.js dependencies in the root and app folder.
npm run prepare-server
```

### Start the server
```
# Use mockserver for production-like data.
npm run mockserver

# Use test-server for testing purposes.

```
There’s no separate start script for UI5. Simply run the mock/test server (as configured) and open: `http://localhost:8080/airports/webapp/index.html`.

### Run UI-Integration Tests (OPA)
To run OPA tests, start the test-server
```
npm run test-server
```
then run the OPA test using
```
npm run opa-test
```
